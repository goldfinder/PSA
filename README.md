# PSA
Player Security Action

## What is PSA?
PSA is a wip roblox security operations system, where once installed, any player who is within the banned list is automatically removed.  This does not apply to everyone, but can be extremely useful to preventing exploiters in the future.

## How does PSA operate?
We operate on a report based system, adding someone to a report and it being successful will add a strike (Or multiple) and a ban onto the player.  The bans can be indefinite unless a appeal is created and approved by staff.  Staff may deny and force the user to wait another few weeks to re-appeal.
